# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The inventory app consists of a system that will allow a user to add and remove items, increase or decrease specific items, and notify the user when the inventory has reached zero. The database has a minimum of two tables with one storing the inventory items and one storing logins and passwords. There is a large grid that contains all the items in the inventory. Lastly, there is a login screen that will prompt the user to enter a username and password, as well as a way to create a new login account. This app will be used for companies that ship items, stores, and consumers.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

There was to be a screen for the main login screen, a screen for inventory and editing the inventory, and a screen for the settings to allow the user to activate SMS notifications. The UI design kept users in mind by creating a theme with easy to read text and easy to push buttons. My designs were successful because they were easy to use. There were no hidden features and everything was straight-forward.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

In order to code the app, I first started out with a UI interface. Sometimes I would code the places or colors for the text or buttons, and sometimes I was able to move it to a different location and the code would change for me. Once this was completed, I was able to tell the app what the editText and buttons would do. In the future I will take a different approach by considering different steps. Sometimes it doesn't work to completely code one small part at a time, rather than complete it as a whole.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I ensured my code was functional by constant testing. Everytime I changed the smallest detail, I clicked "run" to test the app and make sure it changed what I wanted it to change. This process is important because if you code too much at a time and then test it, you could come across and error and not know where it is. In the long run, frequent testing takes less time because some errors could take hours of backtracking to figure out.

# Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

There were so many steps designing and preparing for the app that I thought coding the app would never happen. I am glad that there was a large amount of planning because without it, I would have been running back and forth to figure out what I wanted and what was needed. I came to a crossroad when some of my buttons weren't working correctly. I had to take the skills I learned from ZyBooks and apply them in a different way to figure out why I wasn't successful. In the end, I coded, tested, coded, tested, and was successful.

# In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

When I was able to log into the app and change screens, I was amazed with my production. I felt like getting the first step completed showed that I had a grasp on the app and would be able to figure out more obstacles that were in the way. Sometimes I feel that getting the confidence while working on a project is half the battle. In a prior class I was pretty much stuck on phase 1. It grew on me and I spent more time thinking about how I couldn't figure it out than actually trying to figure it out. I learned that confidence and perseverance can help to tackle any obstacle in the way.
